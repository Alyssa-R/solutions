<p>
Welcome to the Project Drawdown API automated documentation.
</p>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p>
First, <code>GET /login/{provider}</code> where provider is either "google" or "github".
</p>

<p>
Then, visit the URL that is returned <code>{ "url": "https://accounts.google.com ...." }</code>
</p>

<p>
After authenticating with the OAuth provider, the redirect (.env configurable) will contain the oauth code. Pass that code into the request body's "code" attribute to <code>POST /authorize/{provider}</code>.
</p>

<h3>Workbooks</h3>

<p>
To create a new workbook, <code>POST /workbook</code> with a request body as shown in the example below.
</p>

<p>
To retrieve a workbook, <code>GET /workbook/{workbook_id}</code>.
</p>

<p>
To calculate the projections in this workbook, <code>GET /calculate/?workbook_id={workbook_id}&variation_index={variation_index}</code>. Variation index is the index of the variation as listed in <code>GET /workbook/{workbook_id}</code>.
</p>

<p>
To make an edit to a variation, <code>PATCH /workbook/{workbook_id}/variation/{variation_id}</code>, with a request body as shown in the example below.
</p>

<p>
Then you will want to re-calculate the workbook as above. The resulting list of technologies should now include a "diff_path" where a technology's outputs have changed. That path will contain the output for that technology.
